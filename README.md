Fall Guys Game
    Description of Game:
Goal of the game is to intimitate one of the levels of Fall Guys. Where we will have the level of Falls Guys, where we have some sort of propellar that has         multiple fans. 
The goal as a player of the game is to dodge the blades and stay on the platform as long they can while these blades rotate clockwise and counterclockwise simeultaneously. 
We will have a jumping sound effect for everytime the player tries to jump and a collision sound everytime the player collides with a propellar.
We also plan to add random coins that will spawn throughout the platform for the player to earn points on a scoreboard.          
While also having a cool dynamic background to emphasize the scene of the game.
